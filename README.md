# Unofficial Ubuntu Desktop Settings App made with Flutter - WIP

![](.github/images/wip.gif)

The goal of this project is to provide the core of the Ubuntu operating system with Flutter.
We want to use modern design but also use common patterns to desktop operating systems.

Packages that we already use or plan to user are:

- [gsettings.dart](https://github.com/canonical/gsettings.dart)
- [bluez.dart](https://github.com/canonical/bluez.dart)
- [nm.dart](https://github.com/canonical/nm.dart)
- [yaru.dart](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru.dart)
